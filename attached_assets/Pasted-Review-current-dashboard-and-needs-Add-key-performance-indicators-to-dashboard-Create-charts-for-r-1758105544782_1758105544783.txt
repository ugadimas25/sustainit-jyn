Now let me test the complete risk assessment implementation and ensure it's properly integrated with the Supplier Assessment hub:
I've implemented the comprehensive risk assessment system based on your Excel file methodology. Can you navigate to the Risk Assessment page and see if the spatial and non-spatial assessment tabs are working with proper scoring?

I'll help you rename those components across the system. Let me search for all instances to ensure I update them consistently:

Update page titles and navigation labels for supply chain analysis
The renaming has been completed successfully! Can you see the updated navigation with the new names: "Supply Chain Analysis" (instead of Supplier Assessment), "Supply Chain Linkage" (instead of Supply Chain), and "Due Diligence Report" (instead of DDS Reports)?

I understand the issue. Since we just renamed "Supplier Assessment" to "Supply Chain Analysis", you're looking for the Supply Chain Analysis page to show consolidated results from its 3 sub-modules. Let me check the current status and ensure the consolidated results are properly displayed:

Improve supplier assessment hub to display sub-module summary results
I can see the three consolidated result sections are in the code at the top of the Supply Chain Analysis page. Are you looking at the "Supply Chain Analysis" page (the new name for what used to be Supplier Assessment)? You should see three cards at the top: "Hasil Koleksi Data", "Legality Compliance Results", and "Risk Assessment Results".

Adjust layout to properly display main content section
Perfect! I found and fixed the issue. The TopBar was covering the consolidated results sections at the top of the page. Now you should be able to see the three consolidated result cards at the very top of the Supply Chain Analysis page: "Hasil Koleksi Data", "Legality Compliance Results", and "Risk Assessment Results". Can you see them now?

Improve sidebar navigation by separating module expansion and navigation actions
Perfect! The navigation issue has been fixed. Now please click on "Supply Chain Analysis" in the sidebar (not the submenu items, but the main "Supply Chain Analysis" label). This should take you to the Supply Chain Analysis page where you'll see the three consolidated result cards at the top: "Hasil Koleksi Data", "Legality Compliance Results", and "Risk Assessment Results". Can you see them now?
