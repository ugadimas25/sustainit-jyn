   - Nomor Telepon: "+62987654321"
   - Alamat Kantor: "Medan"
   - UML ID: "UML-98765"
3. **Submit**: Click Submit button
4. **ðŸ“‹ COPY THE SUPPLIER ID**: Green notification shows "Data Mill dan Supplier telah berhasil dibuat. Supplier ID: sup_xxxxx"
5. **Verify**: **Tier Assignment** = Tier 1

#### Option C: Smallholder Data Collection
1. **Navigate**: `/data-collection` â†’ "Traceability Data Collection"

5. **Verify**: **Tier Assignment** = Tier 3

#### Option D: KCP/Bulking Station
1. **Navigate**: `/data-collection` â†’ "KCP Data Collection" or "Bulking Station"
2. **Fill Form** with KCP/Bulking details (contact person, email, address)
3. **Submit**: Click Submit button
4. **ðŸ“‹ COPY THE SUPPLIER ID**: Green notification shows "Data KCP/Bulking dan Supplier telah berhasil dibuat. Supplier ID: sup_xxxxx"
5. **Verify**: **Tier Assignment** = Tier 2

**ðŸ”‘ Key Output**: You now have a Supplier ID! Save it in your notepad - you'll use it in Phase 2, 3, 4, and 5.

#### ðŸ“Œ Alternative: How to Find Supplier ID if You Missed the Notification

If you didn't copy the Supplier ID from the notification:
